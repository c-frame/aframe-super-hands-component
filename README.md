### Description

The `super-hands` component interprets input from tracked controllers and 
collision detection components
into interaction gestures and communicates those gestures to 
target entities for them to respond.  

The currently implemented gestures are:

* Hover: Holding a controller in the collision space of an entity
* Grab: Pressing a button while hovering an entity, potentially also moving it
* Stretch: Grabbing an entity with two hands and resizing 
* Drag-drop: Dragging an entity onto another entity

For an entity to respond to the `super-hands` gestures, it needs to have 
components attached to translate the gestures into actions. `super-hands` 
includes components for typical reactions to the implemented gestures: 
`hoverable`, `grabbable`, `stretchable`, and `drag-droppable`.

![Separation of Gesture and Response API](readme_files/super-hands-api.png)

Separating the reaction to be the responsibility of the entity affected allows for extensibility. 
In response to a grab, you may want some entities to lock to the controller and move, 
others to rotate around a fixed point, and others still to spawn a new entity but remain unchanged. 
With this API schema, these options can be handled by adding or creating different reaction
components to the entities in your scene, and `super-hands` can work with all of them.

### News

* Initial launch

#### Known Issues

* Collision zones for stretched entities don't update to new scale (`sphere-collider` does not take entity scale into account)

#### Compatibility

Made for A-Frame v.0.4.0. 

### API

#### super-hands component

`super-hands` should be added to same entities as your controller
component and collision detector (e.g. [aframe-extras sphere-collider](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/blob/master/src/misc) 
or the in-development, physics system-based [physics-collider](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-physics-system/pull/14)).

##### Component Schema

| Property | Description | Default Value |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| colliderState | Name of state added to entities by your chosen collider | `'collided'` (default for `sphere-collider` and `physics-collider`) |
| colliderEvent | Event that your chosen collider emits when identifying a new collision | `'hit'` (default for `sphere-collider` and `physics-collider`) |
| grabStartButtons | Array of button event types that can initiate grab | Trigger, grip, thumb press events |
| grabEndButtons | Array of button event types that can terminate grab | Trigger, grip, thumb release events |
| stretchStartButtons | Array of button event types that can initiate stretch | Trigger, grip, thumb press events |
| stretchEndButtons | Array of button event types that can terminate stretch | Trigger, grip, thumb release events |
| dragDropStartButtons | Array of button event types that can initiate dragging/hovering | Trigger, grip, thumb press events |
| dragDropEndButtons | Array of button event types that can execute drag-drop | Trigger, grip, thumb release events |

Default button events include specific events for `vive-controls`, `hand-controls` and 
`oculus-touch-controls`.

Default start events: 'gripdown', 'trackpaddown', 'triggerdown', 'gripclose', 
'pointup', 'thumbup', 'pointingstart', 'pistolstart', 'thumbstickdown'

Default end events: 'gripup', 'trackpadup', 'triggerup', 'gripopen', 
'pointdown', 'thumbdown', 'pointingend', 'pistolend', 'thumbstickup'

##### Events

Events will be emitted by the entity being interacted with. 
The entity that `super-hands` is attached to is sent in the event `details` as the property `hand`.

| Type | Description | Target |  details object |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| hover-start | Collided with entity | collided entity | hand: `super-hands` entity |
| hover-end | No longer collided with entity | collided entity | hand: `super-hands` entity |
| grab-start | Button pressed while collided with entity and hand is empty | collided entity | hand: `super-hands` entity |
| grab-end | Button released after grab-start | collided entity | hand: `super-hands` entity |
| stretch-start | Both controllers have button pressed while collided with entity | collided entity | hand: `super-hands` entity, secondHand: second controller entity |
| stretch-end | Release of button after stretch-start | collided entity | hand: `super-hands` entity |
| dragover-start | Collision with entity while holding another entity | collided entity & held entity | hand: `super-hands` entity, hovered: collided entity, carried: held entity |
| dragover-end | No longer collided with entity from dragover-start | collided entity & held entity | hand: `super-hands` entity, hovered: collided entity, carried: held entity |
| drag-drop | Button released while holding an entity and collided with another | collided entity & held entity | hand: `super-hands` entity, dropped: carried entity, on: receiving entity |

Notes: 

* References to buttons being "released" and "pressed" are dependent on the schema settings. 
For example, to make grab 'sticky', you could set grabStartButtons to 
'triggerdown' and grabEndButtons to 'gripdown' (as in the 
[sticky example](https://wmurphyrd.github.io/aframe-super-hands-component/examples/#sticky)).
This way the grab-end event would not fire until the grip button was *pressed*, 
even if the trigger was *released* earlier. 
* Only one entity at a time will be targeted for each event type, 
even if multiple overlapping collision zones exist. `super-hands` tracks a 
FIFO queue of collided entities to determine which will be affected.

#### hoverable component

Used to indicate when the controller is within range to interact with an entity
by adding the 'hovered' state. When using a mixin, including another mixin
in the assets withe same id + '-hovered' will activate automatically, as in
[the examples](https://wmurphyrd.github.io/aframe-super-hands-component/examples/).

##### States

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| hovered | Added to entity while it is collided with the controller |

#### grabbable component

Makes and entity move along with the controller while it is grabbed.

This works best with [aframe-physics-system](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-physics-system) 
to manage grabbed entity movement, but it will fallback to manual `position` updates 
(without rotational translation) if physics is not available or is disabled with `usePhysics = never`. 

##### Component Schema

| Property | Description | Default Value |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| usePhysics | Whether to use physics system constraints to handle movement, 'ifavailable', 'only', or 'never' | 'auto' |

##### States

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| grabbed | Added to entity while it is being carried |

#### stretchable component

Makes and entity rescale while grabbed by both controllers as they are moved closer together or further apart.

##### Component Schema

| Property | Description | Default Value |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| usePhysics | Whether to update physics body shapes with scale changes, 'ifavailable' or 'never' | 'ifavailable' |

There is no CANNON api method for updating physics body scale, but `stretchable` will manually rescale basic shapes. Currently rescalable shapes are: box. 

##### States

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| stretched | Added to entity while it is grabbed with two hands |

#### drag-droppable component

`drag-droppable` is a shell component that only manages the 'hovered' state for the entity. 
This can be combined with  with a '-hovered' mixin to easily highlight when an entity is 
hovering in a drag-drop location. 

For more interactivity, consider using `event-set` from [kframe](http://github.com/ngokevin/kframe) 
with the `drag-dropped` event or creating your own component.

##### States

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| dragover | Added to while a carried entity is colliding with a a `drag-droppable` entity |

Add `drag-droppable` to both the carried entity and the receiving entity if you want both of them to 
receive the hovered state.
