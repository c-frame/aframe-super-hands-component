Thanks for helping with `super-hands`!

Two important things to know when contributing:

1. This package uses standard js style. Run `npm run lint` before
   creating a pull request to check your code.
2. This package is validated through [machinima testing](https://github.com/wmurphyrd/aframe-machinima-testing).
   In addition to the unit and integration tests (`npm run test`),
   `super-hands` pull requests need to pass all checks in the
   motion-capture based functional testing suite run by calling
   `npm run test:machinima` from the command line.
